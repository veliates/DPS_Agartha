### Protocol
> Protcol information

### Data/signal/events are required for the interaction / communication between the trucks
#### Signals:
- __Break__: 
- __Decelerate__: 
- __Accelerate__: 
- __Break Acknowledge__: The braking vehicle then sends out ACK (Acknowledge). Preceding vehicles can thus start to brake when the ACK from succeeding cliques arrives. Front vehicle cannot brake until ACK is received from rear that it has started to brake.
